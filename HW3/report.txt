Obstacles Faced

The largest obstacle I had to overcome was staying organized while working on multiple computers.
At first I had a google drive folder to hold my code. However, realized I could set up a github repository, which proved to be much easier.
Once that was settled, reminding myself to consistently write comments for myself, both explaining how code worked and how I planned to implement the functions helped to keep me organized throughout the week.

Test Cases

int countMatches(const string a[], int n, string target);
  - Test negative size case
  - Test zero size case
  - Test no matches case
  - Test 1 match case
  - Test 2 or more match case
  - Test empty string case



int detectMatch(const string a[], int n, string target);

bool detectSequence(const string a[], int n, string target, int& begin, int& end);

int detectMin(const string a[], int n);

int moveToBack(string a[], int n, int pos);

int moveToFront(string a[], int n, int pos);

int detectDifference(const string a1[], int n1, const string a2[], int n2);

int deleteDups(string a[], int n);

bool contains(const string a1[], int n1, const string a2[], int n2);

int meld(const string a1[], int n1, const string a2[], int n2, string result[], int max);

int split(string a[], int n, string splitter);
